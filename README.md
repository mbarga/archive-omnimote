The project is not fully functional as is. The included files are the bare bones source files and header files created for this project.

This project contents are meant for reference only. A video of the device functionality is available from the archived project website.

Some library packages are used that were included in the Keil MCB2300 Dev. Board for the Philips LPC2368 ARM processor. These included most notably the source for USB connectivity functionality.

This is the culmination of the work of 4 people on a team. My personal contributions were the wifi communication with the microcontroller, the LED display routines and the USB communication. The specifics are documented in my notebook here: https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Webs/F10-Grp03/nb/mbarga.html
